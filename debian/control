Description: Debian OS builder
 debos Debian OS builder. debos is a tool to make creation of various
 debian based os "images" simpler. While most other tools focus on
 specific use-case, debos is more meant as a toolchain to make comon
 actions trivial while providing enough rope to do whatever tweaking that
 might be required behind the scene.
